# About the application

This is a demonstration of how to use css flexbox for responsive UI design with react.js. It uses react typescript, and effective state management with react hooks. It uses vanilla css without any external css libraries.

It is a fun game in which the system picks hand signs (paper, rock or scissors) at random, and you attempt to guess which the system picked. It is all about guess work, for fun. You can send your friends link to the game for the to also play and find out who is more lucky at the moment. Every correct guess gives you one point while an incorrect score costs you one point. If you are more unlucky at the moment than you are lucky, your total score may be in negative values. Your ultimate goal is to get large positive scores.

To restart the game, simply refresh your browser.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
