# About the application

This is a demonstration of how to use css flexbox for responsive UI design with react.js. It uses react typescript, and effective state management with react hooks. It uses vanilla css without any external css libraries.

It is a fun game in which the system picks hand signs (paper, rock or scissors) at random, and you attempt to guess which the system picked. It is all about guess work, for fun. You can send your friends link to the game for the to also play and find out who is more lucky at the moment. Every correct guess gives you one point while an incorrect score costs you one point. If you are more unlucky at the moment than you are lucky, your total score may be in negative values. Your ultimate goal is to get large positive scores.

To restart the game, simply refresh your browser.
